# YouTubeDownloader
YoutubeDownloader is an innovative application that has been built using the Java programming language and has been designed to enable users to download Youtube playlists quickly and efficiently. The application has been equipped with powerful features that make it easy for users to manage and download their Youtube playlists with just a few clicks.

Using the application, users can add a Youtube playlist by simply copying and pasting the playlist URL or dragging and dropping the playlist URL into the application window. The application will then use the Selenium library to navigate to the playlist and retrieve all the available videos automatically.

The Page Factory and Page Object Model libraries have been utilized to structure and organize the code in the application, making it easier to maintain and modify. The Page Object Model has been used to represent the various webpages on Youtube, with each page being represented by a separate class that contains the various functions, elements, and properties required to download the videos.
